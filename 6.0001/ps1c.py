# In Part B, you had a chance to explore how both the percentage of your salary that you save each month 
# and your annual raise affect how long it takes you to save for a down payment.  This is nice, but
# suppose you want to set a particular goal, e.g. to be able to afford the down payment in three years.
# How much should you save each month to achieve this?  In this problem, you are going to write a 
# program to answer that question.  To simplify things, assume:
# 3
# 1. Your semiÂ­annual raise is .07 (7%)
# 2. Your investments have an annual return of 0.04 (4%)  
# 3. The down payment is 0.25 (25%) of the cost of the house 
# 4. The cost of the house that you are saving for is $1M.
# You are now going to try to find the best rate of savings to achieve a down payment on a $1M house in 
# 36 months. Since hitting this exactly is a challenge, we simply want your savings to be within $100 of 
# the required down payment.
