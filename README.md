# Working my way through some MIT Open Courseware computer science classes

This is just me working my way through several classes and doumenting my work.  I make no promises that my solutions are correct, but with the exception of whatever the current problem set is I will note if there is a difference between my answers and the posted answers for a given set. 

Also, for anyone reading through these, I welcome any feedback or criticism you might have
